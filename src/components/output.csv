1 was 10 when I first heard this song. I’m 20 now. This song definitely brings back my childhood in a very refreshed manner that I never knew was possible. Thank you Passenger and Ed ❤️,[[0.89]],Positive
"Passenger, when this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and in jail. Now I have a good job, a husband, and I’m healthy. This song and “Clover Cage - Miraculous” are the two songs that helped with my depression. I just want everyone to know that things will get better. We are in this together. I love you ❤😊",[[1.]],Positive

Always felt like Ed Sheeran would do this song well so I searched you tube to see if he’s ever covered it. This feels like I personally willed this into existence,[[0.42]],Negative
